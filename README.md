# Health Analytics Project – AI for Development

This project explores relationships between health expenditure, immunization coverage, and child mortality across six African countries (Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, and Ethiopia) using World Bank data.

## 🧠 Objective
To understand how public health spending relates to key health outcomes in Africa using Python, Seaborn, and OLS regression.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- World Bank Open Data API (`wbdata`)
- Google Colab for reproducible analysis

## ⚙️ Key Methods
- Bivariate and OLS Regression
- Data Visualization with Seaborn
- Comparative Analysis across 6 countries

## 📈 Results
Visualizations highlight the relationship between healthcare spending and under-5 mortality trends. The OLS model shows statistically significant correlations in several cases.
