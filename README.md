# Health Analytics Project

This project explores relationships between health expenditure, immunization coverage, and child mortality across six African countries (Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, and Ethiopia) using World Bank data.

## 🧠 Objective
To understand how public health spending relates to key health outcomes in Africa using Python, Seaborn and OLS regression.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)
- World Bank Open Data API (`wbdata`)
- Google Colab for reproducible analysis

## ⚙️ Key Methods
- Bivariate and OLS Regression
- Data Visualization with Seaborn
- Comparative Analysis across 6 countries

## 📈 Results
Visualizations highlight the relationship between healthcare spending and under-5 mortality trends. The OLS model shows statistically significant correlations in several cases.

### 🧮 Key Findings
- Life expectancy and healthcare expenditure show a strong positive association across six African countries (R² = 0.78).
- GDP per capita has a statistically significant relationship (p < 0.05) with life expectancy.
- Visual patterns suggest countries with higher per-capita health spending tend to achieve better health outcomes.

## Vizualization using Tableau
🩺 Health Analytics Dashboard – Africa (2004–2024)
This interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes the relationship between health expenditure (% of GDP) and life expectancy across six African countries — Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and South Africa — from 2004 to 2024.

## Data Source:
World Bank Open Data (World Development Indicators)

## Key Insights:
-Higher health expenditure is generally associated with increased life expectancy, though country-level disparities persist.
-Egypt and South Africa demonstrate relatively high life expectancy at moderate expenditure levels.
-Nigeria and Ethiopia show lower life expectancy despite similar expenditure shares, suggesting efficiency and policy factors play key roles.

## Technical Details:
-Data cleaned and analyzed using Python (pandas, seaborn, statsmodels)
-Interactive visualization created with Tableau Public
-Includes dynamic year filter and country-level color coding
